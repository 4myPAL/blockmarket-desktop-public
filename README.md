# Blockmarket Desktop Public

This is the public issue and release space for [Blockchain Foundry's](http://blockchainfoundry.co) Blockmarket product. Blockmarket's source code is proprietary but this repository serves as a location for public beta releases, issue tracking, and eventually the final release scheduled for May 22nd, 2017. Blockmarket is intended to be a complete replacement for all of the [Syscoin QT Wallet's](http://syscoin.org) consumer facing functionality, making it more useable and providing new features such as email notification, etc as well.
