# Blockmarket Desktop Public

This is the public issue and release space for [Blockchain Foundry's](http://blockchainfoundry.co) Blockmarket product. Blockmarket's source code is proprietary but this repository serves as a location for public beta releases, issue tracking, and eventually the final release scheduled for May 22nd, 2017. 

Blockmarket is intended to be a complete replacement for all of the [Syscoin QT Wallet's](http://syscoin.org) consumer facing functionality, making it more useable and providing new features such as email notification, etc as well.

**Blockmarket Desktop Status**: *[Beta 2 Released](https://medium.com/@BlockchainFoundry/blockmarket-desktop-beta-2-31656060e6e7)* | [Download Beta 2](https://github.com/syscoin/blockmarket-desktop-public/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta2)

**Blockmarket Desktop Beta 2 Feature Status**: 
* No Escrow interfaces
* No multisig interfaces
* No address book
* No reselling
* Old offer descriptions/titles might need to be edited due to character-encoding updates introduced in beta2

**Note**: Blockmarket Desktop is a beta product and thus is locked to testnet. Bugs, issues, areas of improvement, etc. are all **expected** in this phase of product development. The focus of Beta 2 is cross-platform testing on a larger subset of operating systems (Mac/Windows) and ensuring core functionalty works on those operating systems and further refinement of features delivered in beta1. All features not included in a given beta are still part of Syscoin core and will be present in subsequent beta or final release.
